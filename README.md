# Interpreterprojekt

Although little bit spaghetti it was a lot of fun!

That's project that me and 2 of my friends: [Adam Lewi≈Ñski](https://github.com/lewi9), [Marcin Makulec](#) written for BITEhack 2021. That program is capable of compiling and executing algorithmic notation that was presented to us by professor at academia.

### Komendy.py

This module "translates" Commands from notation into format that's further interpreted in interpreter.py

### Interpreter.py

Module which handles compilation and execution of "translated" code

### main.py

Mainly GUI

#### Disclaimer

I wish that I could describe in more detail how program works but it's kind off old and I don't remember it well, maybe I'll do it some time in future
